### Bikeshare
The title of this project is *bikeshare*

### Description
In this project, I made use of *Python* to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States
*Chicago*, *New York City*, and *Washington*

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of *2017* are provided for all three cities. 
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- *Start Time* (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- *End Time* (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- *Trip Duration* (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- *Start Station* (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- *End Station* (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- *User Type* (Subscriber or Customer)

The *Chicago* and *New York City* files also have the following two columns:

- *Gender*
- *Birth Year*
